### Project Description
The Gesture-Based Recovery Game is designed to assist individuals with motor diseases and other conditions requiring rehabilitation by offering a fun, interactive way to perform hand exercises. By using hand gestures to control the game's character, players can improve their hand mobility, coordination, and strength, all while engaging in a gamified experience.

### The Problem statement
This project aims to develop an interactive game using hand gesture recognition to assist individuals recovering from strokes and other physical disabilities. The game will provide a fun and accessible way for users to engage in rehabilitation exercises, helping them improve motor skills, coordination, and mobility through simple hand movements.

### The Solution
In this app, we solve the problem of controlling the game by using hand gestures, where the player can perform actions such as walking, running, or jumping based on the number of fingers raised, detected through a webcam feed processed by MediaPipe for real-time gesture recognition.
